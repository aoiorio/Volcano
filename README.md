## 🌭 {"What is Volcano"}

**Volcano** is a simple TODO app that can recognize your voices and convert them to texts as a **TODO**.
You can tell your TODO to Volcano like you're speaking with someone.

<br>

## 🧈 {"Why"}

I usually write down my TODOs on my note every single day.
<br>
But I perceived that it's pain in the neck and will definitely forget something what I'm going to do today.

So I came up with an application idea to manage my TODOs with more comfortable way.

I thought recognizing my voice can be a powerful feature to remember what I was planning to do.

That's the reason of why Volcano was created.
